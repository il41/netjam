    <h1>kinetics</h1>
    <h3>in the virtual world of kinetics, users can get together and jam together on simulated and fictional instruments</h3>
      <br>
    make music together in virtual space :)
    <br>
    currently we have drums and a cube array

    <br>
    <br>
    in the near future, multiplayer networks and avatars will be enabled, along with more instruments and sounds
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>planned improvements</h4>
    currently, the sky is sound reactive, but reacts overly fast and will be smoothed in the future. its lighting will also be fixed
    <br>
    <br>
    more instruments will be created with physical modeling and scripts. it would also be fun to add physics based instruments.
    <br>
    some sort of visual feedback on the object to show the sound has been played will also be implemented
    <br>
    <br>
    the multiplayer aspect is the next major step for this project, enabling real-time music collaboration in a virtual world
